# 🌦️ AI Intern Assessment — “Weather Advisor Agent”  
### *Two-Agent System with Live Weather Data and Open-Source LLM Reasoning*

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build a lightweight agentic application that answers everyday weather-related **decision questions** using **live open weather data** and **a reasoning LLM agent**.

You will create two collaborating agents:

1. **Agent 1: Weather Retriever** – fetches forecast data from a free, public weather API  
2. **Agent 2: Reasoning Agent** – uses an open-source LLM to interpret the weather and answer user questions

---

## 🧾 Example Scenarios

- “Should I go hiking tomorrow in Bend?”
- “Will it be good weather for biking in Corvallis today?”
- “Should I plan an outdoor event this weekend in Eugene?”

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements

### 🕷️ Agent 1: Weather Data Retrieval

- Use a **completely free**, open, no-auth weather API:
  - ✅ [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en)
  - ✅ [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in)

### 🧠 Agent 2: LLM-Based Reasoning

Use an **open-source LLM** from Hugging Face:

| Model Name              | Description                              | How to Use                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `google/flan-t5-small`   | Lightweight instruction-following model  | Hugging Face `pipeline`        |
| `facebook/bart-large-cnn`| Great for summarization and reasoning    | Hugging Face `pipeline`        |
| `tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b`    | Chat-style general-purpose open model    | Hugging Face `transformers`    |

📦 All of these can run inside **Google Colab** with no login, no payment, and no setup.

## 📄 Sample Code Snippets

### Agent 1 — Weather Retriever (Open-Meteo)

```python
import requests

def get_weather(lat, lon):
    url = f"https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude={lat}&longitude={lon}&daily=temperature_2m_max,precipitation_sum,wind_speed_10m_max&timezone=auto"
    return requests.get(url).json()
```

### Agent 2 — Reasoning with LLM

```python
from transformers import pipeline

llm = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="google/flan-t5-small")

def reason_about_weather(data, question):
    weather_summary = f"The max temperature is {data['daily']['temperature_2m_max'][0]}°C with {data['daily']['precipitation_sum'][0]}mm rain."
    prompt = f"{weather_summary}\n\nUser question: {question}\nAnswer:"
    return llm(prompt, max_length=100)[0]['generated_text']
```
